We deliver needle-moving initiatives which provide a seamless experience to Amazon Sellers at each step of the Seller journey. We enable Sellers across the world to list millions of products at scale across multiple categories and dozens of languages in our global Marketplaces. This includes automatically mapping Seller product information to the Amazon namespace and automating complex decision making (like Product Classification in our Catalog) on the Seller\u2019s behalf. We provide Sellers with strategic selling recommendations based on hybrid demand signals (like high-value products they should start selling in additional Marketplaces). We partner with Amazon Business to build best-in-class solutions that allow B2B Sellers to reach a wide customer base and drive billions of dollars in revenue. We continuously improve the state of the existing catalog created by Amazon Sellers through smart solutions that automatically identify and fix defects using self-learning heuristics leveraging textual and image-based signals. And more\u2026<br/> <br/> Selling on Amazon is one of the fastest growing businesses at Amazon with more than half of all items currently sold originating from 3rd party Sellers. In this team you'll be using cutting edge technologies to build highly distributed systems for our Sellers around the world. You\u2019ll learn and use the latest technology frameworks such as AWS and Machine Learning. You will join a highly technical and entrepreneurial culture defining and building a selling experience to complement Amazon's world-class e-commerce buying experience. As we take bold bets on challenging problems, you will have autonomy to deliver projects from inception to deployment and beyond.<br/> <br/> In this role you will be responsible for scoping and delivering large projects end-to-end. Responsibilities include collection of business and systems requirements from internal and external customers, writing specifications, driving project schedules from design to release, and managing the production launch. You will lead and coordinate design/implementation efforts between teams internal to ISG and other partner teams outside of ISG to develop optimal solutions. You will be expected to make appropriate tradeoffs to optimize time-to-market. You will also clearly communicate goals, roles, responsibilities, and desired outcomes to internal cross-functional and remote project teams. The right candidate will possess a strong program management background, will have demonstrated experience leading medium to large projects, and will have a well-rounded technical background in current web technologies. You must be able to thrive and succeed in an entrepreneurial environment, and not be hindered by ambiguity or competing priorities. This means you are not only able to develop and drive high-level strategic initiatives, but can also roll up your sleeves, dig in and get the job done. <br/> As a TPM, you will anticipate bottlenecks, provide escalation management, anticipate and make tradeoffs, and balance the business needs versus technical constraints. An ability to take large, complex projects and break them down into manageable pieces, develop functional specifications, then deliver them in a successful and timely manner is expected. Maturity, high judgment, negotiation skills, ability to influence, analytical talent and leadership are essential to success in this role.<br/><br/>",
